There are two buttons '+' and '-' in the first counter. Initially the value of the counter is zero. The '+' button increases the count by one and the '-' button decreases the count by one. So the counter value can be above zero or below zero (negative values).

Second counter increaments automatically starting from zero. Initially there will be only one incremental counter. We can add as many counter as we want by clicking 'Add Increment Counter' button.

In the third counter we can find only one decrement counter, a 'Rmove Counter' button and an 'Add Decrement Counter' button. Clicking 'Add Decrement Counter' button adds one counter and a 'Remove Counter' button for every click. To remove a counter we can click 'Remove Counter' button below corresponding counter. All these decremental counters decreament by themselves.
